## Database Design Instructions: ERD to Relational Schema

This section outlines the step-by-step process for converting an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) into a relational database schema. Use it as a general guide when solving the problems in this repository.

### Step 1: Identify and Create Entity Tables

- Rule: Each entity type in your diagram becomes its own table.
- Action:
  1. Create a table for the entity.
  2. Convert the entity's attributes into columns in that table.
  3. Choose a Primary Key:
     - It can be a Simple (single column) or Composite (multiple columns) key.
     - It must be Not Null, Unique, and Minimal (no unnecessary columns).

Example: Create tables for `User`, `Post`, `PostImage`, `Like`, and `Comment`.

### Step 2: Handle 1:1 (One-to-One) Relationships

This depends on the participation constraint (Total or Partial) of the entities involved.

| Participation (S, T) | What to do? | Where to put Relationship Attributes? |
|----------------------|------------|---------------------------------------|
| Both Total (S: Total, T: Total) | Merge the two tables `S` and `T` into a single table. | Add them as columns in the merged table. |
| One Partial, One Total (S: Partial, T: Total) | Add a Foreign Key to the table with Total participation (`T`) that references the Primary Key of the other table (`S`). This FK can also become the PK of `T`. | Add them as columns to the table with the Foreign Key (`T`). |
| Both Partial (S: Partial, T: Partial) | Add a Foreign Key to either table `S` or `T` referencing the Primary Key of the other. | Add them as columns to the table you placed the Foreign Key in. |

### Step 3: Handle 1:N (One-to-Many) Relationships

- Identify the sides: which entity is on the "1" side (`T`) and which is on the "N" side (`S`).
- Action:
  1. Add a Foreign Key in the table on the "N" side (`S`) that refers to the Primary Key of the "1" side (`T`).
  2. Place any attributes of the relationship into the "N" side table.

Example: A User authors a Post (1:N). Add `author_id` in the `Post` table referencing `User(user_id)`.

### Step 4: Handle M:N (Many-to-Many) Relationships

- Action:
  1. Create a new table `R` to represent the relationship.
  2. Add relationship attributes as columns in `R`.
  3. Add Foreign Keys in `R` referencing the Primary Keys of both participating tables.
  4. The Primary Key of `R` is typically the combination of these Foreign Keys (composite key).

Example: A "Like" between `User` and `Post` becomes table `Like(user_id, post_id)`.

### How to Apply These Instructions

1. Start with Step 1. List all your entities and create a table for each.
2. For each relationship, determine its type (1:1, 1:N, or M:N).
3. Follow Steps 2â€“4 accordingly.
4. Add constraints (PK, FK, UNIQUE, CHECK) to enforce integrity.

## Problem 07: Project Management System

### Description
A software company needs a system to manage its projects, tasks, and employees. The system must track project details, task assignments, team compositions, and task dependencies.
You are asked to design an ERD for the following scenario:

- The system manages multiple **Projects**. Each project has a ProjectID, Name, StartDate, EndDate, and Budget.
- Each project is composed of multiple **Tasks**. Each task has a TaskID, Description, DueDate, Status (e.g., 'To Do', 'In Progress', 'Done'), and Priority (e.g., 'High', 'Medium', 'Low'). A task must belong to exactly one project.
- Tasks can have dependencies. A task can be a prerequisite for one or more other tasks. This creates a self-referencing relationship on the Task entity.
- The company has **Employees**. Each employee has an EmployeeID, Name, Email, and JobTitle.
- Employees are organized into **Teams**. Each team has a TeamID and a TeamName. An employee can belong to only one team at a time, but a team consists of many employees.
- Tasks are assigned to employees. An employee can be assigned many tasks, and a task can be assigned to multiple employees (a joint task). For each assignment, the system should record the date of assignment.
- The system also needs to track **TimeLogs**. An employee can log time spent on a specific task. Each time log entry should have a LogID, HoursWorked, and the date the work was performed.

### Requirements
1. Identify all the entities.
2. Identify the attributes for each entity, including primary and foreign keys.
3. Identify any weak entities.
4. Define the relationships between entities (detect the cardinality and participation).
5. Represent any self-referencing (recursive) relationships.
6. Draw the ERD diagram.
7. Map the ERD to a relational schema.
8. Write SQL code in PostgreSQL to create the schema.
